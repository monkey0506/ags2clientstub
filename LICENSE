// This stub is a non-functional replacement for game-client plugins for

// to redistribute the game to platforms where the plugin is not
// supported, without having to rebuild the game.
//
// NOTICE: The full AGSteam plugin cannot be made open-source due to
// restrictions enforced by Valve's strict licensing on the Steamworks
// API. If you are a developer who has signed an NDA with Valve and have
// access to Steamworks, access can be granted to the full AGSteam plugin
// source. For more information you may contact monkey0506 via email at
